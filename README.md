# battleships
A simple game of "Battleships". To begin, open `index.html` file. At first you need to choose where your ships will be. To do that, select a ship from left-side ships menu, and then click on map where you want it to be. Right-mouse-click changes ship's direction. Placing ships contains one bug (see "Issues"). In order to win, hit all CPU's ships.
